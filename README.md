## About this Kata

Alistair Cockburn wrote a blog post about this kata, in response to the Seb Rose kata proposition.

## Problem Description

Given a letter, print a diamond starting with ‘A’ with the supplied letter at the widest point.

For example: print-diamond ‘C’ prints

```
  A
 B B
C   C
 B B
  A
```

* Run `stack exec -- diamond-haskell-exe` to see "We're inside the application!"
* With `stack exec -- diamond-haskell-exe --verbose` you will see the same message, with more logging.
